# To-Do List App

A simple and efficient To-Do List application built using React. This app leverages React hooks such as `useState` and `useEffect`, alongside Bootstrap and React Icons for styling. It includes full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing tasks.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Create a new task with a title and description.
- **Edit Tasks**: Update task details directly from the task list.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove completed or unnecessary tasks.
- **Mark as Complete**: Track progress by marking tasks as complete.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with Bootstrap for a user-friendly interface on all devices.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Hooks**: `useState` and `useEffect` for state management and side effects.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive design and pre-styled components.
- **React Icons**: For enhancing the visual appeal with icons.
